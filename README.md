# Tessellation of Micro-structurally Aware Domains using Neper

This repository showcases the work completed for an independent research project under the supervision of Prof. Ravi Sastry Ayyagari at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Department of Mechanical Engineering.

### Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to develop fully functional end-to-end C++ code to generate tessellation files (for both 2-D and 3-D tessellations) using the available grain information to accurately represent microstructurally aware domains.

### Key Contributions
- **Developed a C++ Codebase:** Authored a comprehensive end-to-end C++ code to automate the generation of tessellation files based on available grain information, capable of handling both 2-D and 3-D configurations.
- **Algorithm Examination and Execution:** Studied the core algorithms of Neper and implemented a mapping technique to tessellate both convex and non-convex domains efficiently.
- **Enhanced Functionality of Neper:** Ensured that the generated tessellations were seamlessly parsed through Neper, thus enhancing its meshing capabilities and visualization features.
